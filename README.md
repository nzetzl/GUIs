GUIs
====

Messing around with some basic JOptionPane GUIs, specifically ones that don't go away

PopUps.java- a new JOptionPane opens after one is closed. Only way to stop it is to stop the program.

CirclePopUps.java- Each new pane appears to go around the screen

XPopUps.java - Each new pane appears to move in an X formation
